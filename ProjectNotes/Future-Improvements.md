# Future Improvements — Backlog

Ideas captured for later work. Nothing in this file has been scoped, designed, or approved for implementation — these are raw notes to revisit and plan properly when picked up.

---

## 1. Withdraw request → offer resubmission ✅ Complete (2026-08-06)

When a client withdraws a submitted investigation request, the client-facing UI should either:
- Ask if they want to submit the request to another organization, or
- Show a button to resubmit it.

Related: the Declined-status resubmit flow already built for `ClientRequestController`/`ClientRequests.razor` (2026-08-05, `AddOrganization` endpoint + "Choose Another Organization" picker) is the natural pattern to extend here — a withdrawal is a different trigger than a decline, but the same "pick another org" UI could likely be reused.

> **Shipped on `feature/withdraw-request-resubmit`:** `AddOrganization` now accepts `Withdrawn` in addition to `Declined`; `ClientRequests.razor` shows the same picker (relabeled "Resubmit to an Organization") for withdrawn requests. Also fixed a related gap found along the way: `Withdraw` previously left any still-open `ClientRequestOrganization` rows untouched, so a withdrawn request kept appearing in the organization's pending-requests list — it now cancels them, mirroring the pattern already used when one org accepts and the others are superseded.

## 2. SuperAdmin visibility into all cases and investigations ✅ Complete (2026-08-06)

A user with the SuperAdmin role should be able to view all cases and investigations across every organization, not just ones they're a member of.

> **Shipped on `feature/superadmin-all-cases-investigations`:** per-org case/investigation reads already bypassed the membership check for SuperAdmin (`CanReadAsync`), but there was no way to discover which orgs to look at without already knowing. Added `AdminCaseController`/`AdminInvestigationController` (`api/admin/cases`, `api/admin/investigations`, SuperAdmin-only) that join across every org, plus two new admin pages (`/admin/cases`, `/admin/investigations`) linked from the Administration side panel, each opening straight into the org's case detail page.

---

## 3. "My Investigations" — clickable detail view ✅ Complete (2026-08-06)

Under "My Investigations," each investigation should be clickable and open a detail view showing whatever the current user has permission to see: other members' notes, research, media, evidence, votes, etc.

> **Shipped on `feature/my-investigations-detail-view`:** rather than building a new consolidated view (which would mean re-implementing every existing permission check), each investigation card now navigates to the existing `CaseDetail.razor` page — it already gates every tab (Notes, Research, Files, Reports, etc.) with the same case-manager-or-org-member checks used everywhere else, so "whatever the user has permission to see" was already correct there. Added `?tab=` query-param support to `CaseDetail.razor` so the link lands directly on the Investigations tab instead of Overview.

---

## 4. Client-facing case log (timeline, sub-clients, evidence)

Clients should be able to return to their submitted request/case after submission and:
- Add new timeline entries for new experiences or evidence.
- Add media (audio/photo/video) as evidence.
- Add other people who have had experiences at the property as **sub-clients**: the primary client can invite someone by email to create an account, which gets linked to the case as a sub-client. Or, without requiring an account, add basic info about a person (name, age, relationship, whether they live there) so they can be referenced in notes/timeline entries — this basic-info version should be scrubbable/removable when the case is made public.
- Every client-side write to the case log should create an audit log entry capturing IP address and user info.

This is effectively a client-owned "case log" surface, distinct from the org/investigator-side case tools that already exist.

---

## 5. Replace raw IDs with names + contextual links

Several screens (organization detail, various grids) currently display raw GUIDs for users and organizations instead of names. Should instead show:
- **Users:** display name, linked to the user's profile/detail page if the current viewer has permission to view that user; otherwise plain text (no link).
- **Organizations:** display name, linked based on the viewer's relationship to the org:
  - Not a member → link to the org's public home page.
  - Member → link to a member-facing org page, with sub-navigation/access scoped to the viewer's role/claims within that org.

This is a cross-cutting UI convention change, likely touching many grids/detail pages — worth auditing for every place an `AppUserId`/`OrganizationId` is rendered directly.

---

## 6. Universal media library component

A general-purpose media component/picker, usable both standalone (a personal media library page) and embedded (e.g. as the media picker inside the Ben.Video editor). Requirements:

- **Views:** thumbnail grid (OS-folder style) or detail list (file size, name, date, etc.), user-toggleable.
- **Scope of files shown:**
  - Files the current user uploaded/created.
  - Files shared with the user by others — shown with a badge indicating it's shared, plus who shared it (name, not ID) and when.
  - Files shared within any organization the user is a member of, at the org, case, or investigation level.
- **Sharing model per file (owner-controlled):**
  - Share with: specific person, investigation team, entire organization, or public.
  - Optional voting: let viewers rate the file's evidentiary strength (e.g. least-likely to most-likely evidence of a haunting, or likely fake).
  - Optional commenting, independently toggleable per audience: investigation team, client, organization, general public (if the file is public).
- **Investigation-file copy semantics:** when a file is attached to an investigation, a copy/record is made into the case's investigation folder so it remains available for the case summary even if the original uploader later deletes or changes their personal copy. If the owner re-uploads a file, prompt whether they're replacing it — if yes, update the investigation's copy too.
- **Reuse target:** this component should become the universal media-selection tool wherever media is picked — including as the asset picker inside Ben.Video, since it already indexes all investigation- and user-owned media.

This is the largest item here — likely its own multi-phase effort (data model for sharing/voting/commenting permissions, the copy-on-attach semantics, the UI component itself, and the Ben.Video integration point).

## 7. Drag-to-scrub playhead on audio file records

On audio file playback/preview (e.g. `AudioFilePreview.razor`/`WaveSurferPlayer.razor`), let the user click-and-drag the mouse on the waveform's playhead to scrub through the audio, not just click-to-seek.
